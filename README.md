# About CLoNe:

Hyperbolic conservation laws on networks have a large number of applications, including fluid flow in pipelines, traffic flow on a network of roads, blood flow in vessels, datanetworks, irrigation channels and supply chains.

CLoNe is a finite volume code to solve conservation laws on networks.

The mathematical theory behind the code can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06400
